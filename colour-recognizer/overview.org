* Colour-recognizer

A quick test of [[https://www.tensorflow.org][TensorFlow]], written to learn a bit about the framework.

The idea is to train on a collection of images, divided into sets based on colour. When handed a new image, the network should then spit out a tuple of probablities for the image with the values generated from the classifiers along with their confidence levels.
This may change when I start working on it. For now, the test data has been found and I've started working on the code.

The training and test dataset has been copied from [[https://www.kaggle.com/ayanzadeh93/color-classification]], with some minor cleanup.

Note that this is not really a good way of trying to calculate the colour of a given image, but I'm hoping to learn a bit about the way Tensorflow works by doing it.
